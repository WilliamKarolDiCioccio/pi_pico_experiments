# Pi Pico Experiments

Welcome to the **pi_pico_experiments** repository! This is where I share the code I write while learning embedded programming using the Raspberry Pi Pico. The will contain various experiments, examples, and projects that I create as I explore and master new concepts in hardware development. This work is made possible by the generous gift of a Raspberry Pi Pico from a dear friend, and I hope it serves as both a personal learning resource and a potential reference for others who are beginning their journey in embedded systems.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and contribute if you have any suggestions or improvements!
